	Mitm - Man in the middle tool written in C
==============================================================

 This tool can be use to perform a man in the middle using ARP
 poisoning on two given hosts.

 Using osdep, a tunnel creation library which is part of the 
 aircrack project, it can set up an interface (mitm0) in which
 the packets will be written (two sniff easily).

 This tool is useful for network debugging and monitoring, and 
 was NOT designed for malicious usage.
